claim_fraud_prediction
=============================

This *work-in-progress* project is focused on building a model to predict whether an insurance claims is fraudulent.


project_summary
=============================

Predicting whether or not a claim is fraudulent can help insurance companies to better manage risk. This project is focused on using machine learning to predict whether or not an insurance claims is fraudulent using data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/insurance-claim) relating to the policy holder, vehicle, and incident. A logistic regression, random forest classifier and decision tree were fitted to the data. Next steps for the project include experimenting with other machine learning models, feature engineering, and parameter optimisation.
